let me explain how to use it:

Save the script to a Python file, for example, steganography.py.
Install the necessary dependencies by running pip install argparse pillow in your terminal or command prompt.
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the steganography.py file is saved.
To encode a message in an image, run the following command:

`python steganography.py`

This will encode the message "Your secret message" into the image and save the result to output image.

To decode a message from an image, run the following command:

`python steganography.py`

This will decode the message from the image input and print it to the console.

Note that the input image must be in PNG format. The script uses the Pillow library to load and manipulate the images. Also, keep in mind that the message you want to encode should not be too long, as the maximum amount of information that can be embedded in an image depends on the image's dimensions.
